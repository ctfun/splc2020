SPLC2020 conference modeling contents - Submission 45

This repository contains the published domain case studies found in our submitted work to SPLC2020 (https://http://splc2020.net)
Using [Clafer](http://clafer.org), v0.4.3, developed inside [ISC2 Project] (https://www.irt-systemx.fr/en/projets/isc/)

The repository is structured as follows:
* root - final model (and branchings)
* xp1 - body related to modeling strategies to encoding the deployment problem in an heterogeneous context
* xp2 - body related to improving the resolution thanks to customized resolution strategy
* xp3 - body related to improving the resolution thanks to customized resolution strategy (domain constraints added)
* xp4 - body related to improving the constraints for resolution (redundancy constraints)
